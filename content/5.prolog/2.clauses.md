# Variables in Prolog

Any word that begins with an uppercase letter is a Variable.

# Clauses in Prolog

A clause is a `procedure` that works for any variable.

```prolog
greater(M, N):-
  M > N,
  write(M), tab(2), write("is greater.")
greater(M, N):-
  M < N,
  write(N), tab(2), write("is greater.")
greater(M, N):-
  write("They are equal.")
```

The clauses can then be run like this:

```sh
?- greater(3, 123).
123  is greater.
true.

?- greater(3, 3).
They are equal.
true.
```
