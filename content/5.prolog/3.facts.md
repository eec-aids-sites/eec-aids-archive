# Facts in Prolog

Facts are like clauses, but without a body.

```prolog
parent(lion, cub).
```

The above line says that the relation between a `lion` and a `cub` is `parent`.

You can query either of the two members using a **variable**.

Variables always start with an uppercase letter.

```prolog
parent(lion, cub).
parent(donkey, kid).
parent(cow, calf).

color(banana, yellow).
color(sky, blue).
color(cotton, white).
```

```sh
$ swipl myfile.prolog

?- parent(cow, calf).
Yes.

?- parent(What, kid).
What = donkey
Yes.

?- color(banana, What).
What = yellow
Yes.
```

However,

```sh
?- color(banana, what).
No.
```

Since the `what` began with a lowercase letter, Prolog did not consider it a variable and assumed it was a constant.
