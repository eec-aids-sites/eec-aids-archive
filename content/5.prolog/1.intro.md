# Introduction to Prolog

Prolog is an interactive, logic-based programming language. 

### A simple print statement

You can write to STDOUT using the `write()` procedure.

```prolog
write("Hello World").
```

We use the `.` symbol as a delimiter (like `;` in C).

We can join multiple commands in one go, using the `,` separator.

```prolog
write("Hello"), nl, write("World").
```

`nl` is a built-in command to add a newline.
