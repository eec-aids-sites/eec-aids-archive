The find-S algorithm finds the most specific hypothesis that fits all the
positive examples.

## Algorithm

- Start with the most specific hypothesis.
  ```ts
  h = [ϕ, ϕ, ϕ, ϕ, ϕ, ϕ];
  ```
- We generally take the first positive example as the most specific hypothesis.

### Training
- Take the first example and see if it is positive.
  - If the example is positive and we find that our initial hypothesis is too
    specific (current example != hypothesis) then we update our current
    hypothesis to a general condition `?`.
  - If not, then no changes occur to the hypothesis.
- Keep repeating the above steps till all the training examples are complete.
- After we have completed all the training examples we will have the final
  hypothesis when can use to classify the new examples.

## Program

- Download the dataset from the link above.

- Import CSV reader.
  ```python
  import csv
  ```
- Read data from the CSV file.
  ```python
  data = []
  with open('play_tennis.csv', 'r') as csvfile:
      reader = csv.reader(csvfile)
      for row in reader:
          data.append(row)
  ```
- Skip the header row.
  ```python
  data = data[1:]
  ```
- The dataset has `num_attributes + 1` columns with the last column being the
  label (`Yes` / `No`).
  ```python
  num_attributes = len(data[0][:-1])
  ```
- Initialize the most specific hypothesis `h`.
  ```python
  h = ['0'] * num_attributes
  ```
  - Find the first positive example and use it as the most specific hypothesis.
    ```python
    first_index = 0
    for i in range(len(data)):
        if data[i][num_attributes] == 'Yes':
            first_index = i
            break
    ```
    ```python
    for j in range(0,num_attributes):
        h[j] = data[first_index][j]
    ```
- Implement Find-S Algorithm
  ```python
  for i in range(0,len(data)):
      if data[i][num_attributes] == 'Yes':
        for j in range(0, num_attributes):
            if data[i][j] != h[j]:
                h[j] = '?'
      print("For example {0}:".format(i), h)
  ```
  For out dataset, the output would be:
  ```ts
  For example 0: ['sunny', 'warm', 'normal', 'strong', 'warm', 'same']
  For example 1: ['sunny', 'warm', '?', 'strong', 'warm', 'same']
  For example 2: ['sunny', 'warm', '?', 'strong', 'warm', 'same']
  For example 3: ['sunny', 'warm', '?', 'strong', '?', '?']
  ```
- Our most specific hypothesis is the value of `h` after the last iteration:
  ```python
  h = ['sunny', 'warm', '?', 'strong', '?', '?']
  ```
